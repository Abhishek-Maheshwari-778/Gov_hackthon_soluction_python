# Aadhaar Seva Pulse: Smart Resource Innovation
**Hackathon 2026 Submission**

## Project Overview
**"Tracking India's Pulse through Aadhaar Updates"**
This project transforms raw Aadhaar transaction logs into a high-frequency decision support system for the government. Instead of static census data, we use **Demographic Updates** to track internal migration and **Biometric Updates** to monitor digital compliance in real-time.

## How to Run the Code
This solution is consolidated into a single **Jupyter Notebook** for reproducibility.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab

### Installation
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas plotly notebook numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Execution
1.  Open **`work.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2.  Run all cells (`Cell > Run All`).
3.  The notebook will automatically:
    - Scan the data directories.
    - Merge 100+ fragmented CSV files.
    - Generate interactive Plotly maps and charts inline.

## Key Highlights (What to Look For)
1.  **Migration Hubs:** Check the bar chart to see top districts with high "Adult Address Updates" (indicating urbanization).
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** Scroll to the bottom to see the "Outlier Analysis" identifying districts with critical infrastructure pressure.
3.  **State Heatmap:** A matrix view comparing Migration vs. Compliance across all states.

## File Structure
- `work.ipynb`: Main source code and analysis engine.
- `processed_district_data.csv`: The cleaned, aggregated dataset generated by the script.
- `data/`: Folder containing raw anonymized Aadhaar datasets.
